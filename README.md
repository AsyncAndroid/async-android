# Where to Find Us

Currently, AsyncAndroid focuses on creating videos for AsyncAndroid's YouTube channel:

https://youtube.com/asyncandroid

AsyncAndroid regularly posts about drops and videos on our Twitter account:

https://twitter.com/asyncandroid

# How We Post Content

- We release any videos submitted in a given week *Thursday @ 1:00PM GMT/BST*.
  - @asyncandroid will tweet an overall drop tweet
  - @asyncandroid will tweet out each video in an individual tweet with each tweet spaced out
- **Videos must be submitted by Monday @ 7:00AM GMT/BST.**
  - Any videos that are submitted after this time will be published in the drop for the following week.
  - Minor changes or corrections may be made after this date but require re-uploads, and thus will be limited.
- Videos release in "drops" that use the old Android version naming convention of alphabetically ordered sweet names. We always love suggestions for obscure sweets!
  - Each drop becomes a playlist on our YouTube channel.
  - If we have only one or two submissions in a week, we may delay publication till a following week when we have more submissions.

# How to Contribute

1. Contact an AsyncAndroid creator/admin:
   - Admins: [Huyen Tue Dao](https://twitter.com/queencodemonkey), [Hugo Visser](https://twitter.com/queencodemonkey), [Mike Wolfson](https://twitter.com/mikewolfson), [Chiu-Ki Chan](https://twitter.com/chiuki)
   - Send a help request via the [AsyncAndroid Help Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pbCtSQq5lo0imPK_ESe9LfW7uSjhQ61Psjoh1si-hVg/edit)
2. Add a proposal to the [AsyncAndroid Proposal Sign-up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z8hdmXvD3Y1KvEK_th8c22PLW45xp_IR6ivd6YoqZhU/edit#gid=0)
   - This spreadsheet is for both creators and managers to see what other videos have been suggested and to avoid excessive overlap in video subjects.
   - Please don't be discouraged if a another proposal is similar but not identical. When in doubt, please consult one of the admins.
   - Before you start creating content, please get confirmation from an admin that your proposal has been accepted.
3. Wait for an approval from one of the admins for your proposal.
4. Create your content.
   - You're free to use whatever format of video you like: a simple screen recording, mixed video and screen recording, voice and slides, voice and code, etc.
   - Please use the same level of professionalism and appropriateness that you would for a conference. Of course, feel free to inject your own personality and humor, but in terms of language, tone, and subject matter, please be mindful.
   - We do reserve the right to not publish submitted videos that are deemed inappropriate, low-quality, off-topic, or that do not reflect values of mutual respect, diversity of people and opinions, and a sharing/educational spirit.
5. Submit your content.
   1. Please refer to the **Submission Checklist** below and make sure you have everything done before proceeding.
   2. Please submit your content using the [AsyncAndroid Video Submission](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1shEt67Gwsi65G_xyqU3kDd3w7qAtoEnEUXtve-laSbo/edit) form.
   3. You will receive an email when your video has uploaded to the AsyncAndroid YouTube channel. The email will contain a link to your video.
      - Your video will be Unlisted at this point. Anyone with the link may view the video, but this is mainly for you and any other reviewers to use.
      - Please do not publicly distribute or promote your video link until the drop date.
      - Once your video is scheduled, YouTube automatically makes your video private. The link will remain the same, but only AsyncAndroid channel admins will be able to view the video.
   4. An admin will review your video and let you know if they find any mistakes or technical issues or that you are good to go and when your video will go live.
   5. If you would like to do a [YouTube Premiere](https://trello.com/b/eXFOWFZa/async-android) for your video, please notify an admin when you submit your video.
      - A YouTube Premiere essentially turns the release of your video into a live event where viewers can tune into to watch your video and chat with other views and you.
      - Please only request a Premiere only if you intend to attend the Premiere and chat with viewers.
      - YouTube Premieres can be scheduled for whatever time works best for you on Thursday as opposed to the usual 1:00 BST.
   6. Once you are scheduled for release, please tweet and otherwise promote your video once it goes live. You can feel free to tease your video release, but please do not widely share your video link.
      - We want to coordinate the release and widespread promotion of all scheduled videos.
      - Your link will likely be private a few days after submission since that is the status that YouTube uses for scheduled but not-yet-published videos.
